VERSION 2019.07:
    --Fix bug in hessian function, which would fail to compute the Hessian if evaluation
    point was int (instead of float).
    --hessian and jacobian can take lists of numbers as evaluation points; they will
    be converted to numpy arrays.
    --Simplified notation in implementation of golden search method.
    --Added Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel solvers for linear equations.


VERSION 2018.08:
    --Changed "print=" keyword to "show=" in several solvers. This is to avoid
    confusion with the python "print" reserved keyword. As of this version, using
    the old keyword will raise a warning. Future version will raise an error.

    --Added an option to demo.savefig to specified file formats
